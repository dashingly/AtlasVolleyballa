Atlas of volleyball beaches and spots around the world

Best Spots around the world to play volleyball

Whenever I am at home, and especially when I go on a vacation - I always want to play beach volleyball.
Volleyball is my religion. It is a religion that worships health, fun and nature. The attributes of this religion are sand, sunshine, phisical activity and people in swimwear, in particular girls in bikinis. The duality and the paradox of this religion is to be able to push yourself past your limits, most notably when diving for the ball or when gousting at the net, while at the same time to have fun and trully enjoy life and the moment.

In this blog I will aim to list and review different beach volleyball locations that I have visited and played on. The purpose is to make it easier for others to plan their vacations, to promote beach volleyball and perhaps to attract other to share information of the spots/destinations they liked or did not like. I will greatly appretiate it if you send any such information to my email AtlasVolleyballa at gmail.com

Locations:
## Canada
* Toronto - the capital of beach volleyball.
    * Woodbine beach - 100s of nets - https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/prd/facilities/complex/311/index.html
    * Sunnyside - 2 nets.
    * Ontario place - 1 net?
    * Wassaga beach - 2 hours from Toronto. 
* Vancouver
## Cuba
* Varadero 
    1. Los Cactus (4*) - 2 nets. One on the beach and the better one in front of the cafeteria, separated from the beach by trees. Good net, no wind. Animators play volleyball. Some good folks: Tony (Animator supervisor), Dino, Ramon and others. Very decent level of volleyball. If you have, bring your own lines. There are also nets on the beach in the nearby hotels.
    2. Barlavento (3.5*) - there is net, it's ok but not great.
* Cayo Santa Maria
    1. Hotel Meli√° Las Dunas - net is behind a dune, but lots of sharp rocks.
    2. Hotel Melia Cayo Santa Maria - next to Las Dunas, better net and lifeguards play volleyball
## USA
* Los Angeles
* Chicago
* Seattle
## Nicaragua
* San Juan del Sur (SJDS) - good net, bad field and very competitive level of play. The net is good and tight, but the field has (had in 2018) a lot of rocks on it, after tides and storms. Nicaraguan olimpic players often play here and thus the level of play is very good. The downside is that most of the people on the court do not speak English and the teens often take over the net for indefinite amount of time. 
## Bahamas
* Nassau, Hotel Riu Palace Paradise Island (4*) has a net
## Dominican Republic
* Punta Cana
    * Playa Los Corales - there are some nets, but they are not great and the level of play is "drunk/sunburned tourist".
    * Playa Macao - no nets, but some surfing and freshly caught fish.
* Las Terrenas - one net on the very tip of the paninsula, hard surface.
* Cabarrette - no nets
## Italy
* Tirrenia near Pisa - decent net, but mostly kids playing, near Grand Hotel Continental.
## Russia
* Novorossisk
* Anapa
* Stavropol
## Brazil
## Colombia
## Costa Rica
